# Why is a header file necessary?
The purpose of a header file is to put all your forward declarations in one place.
Let's say that there are two cases with and without a header file.
<No header file>
a.cpp including functions a_1 and a_2 -> nothing to do
b.cpp including functions using a_1 -> forward declaration for the function a_1 in a.cpp
main.cpp using a.cpp and b.cpp -> forward declarations for the functions in a.cpp and b.cpp
<header file>
ab.h -> header guard and all forward delcarations needed in the program
a.cpp -> nothing to do
b.cpp -> include the header file
main.cpp -> include the header file
In short, if we have a header file, we don't need to declare all functions in every cpp file. 

# Why header guard is needed?
Header guards are designed to ensure that the contents of a given header file are not copied, more than once, into any single file to prevent duplicate definitions.
